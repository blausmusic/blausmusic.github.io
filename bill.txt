bill
oh bill
bill he hits the floor and checks his watch
that's seventeen and eight o'clock
another week, another jetski, could be
another day spent staring at numbers
turning paper into more paper he 
hears that lunchtime sound
hits the floor going down but on his way
toward the ground he hears an unfamiliar sound
the line groans, the lights spark
bill is left alone in the dark
nothing but his watch and pounding heart 
the second passes he pushes up his glasses
looks again at that old watch face
minutes go by
he's prepared to die he thinks 
i'm getting the hell out of this place
before bill blows it as some would say
back in his office for the first time he enjoys
the view. "What gives, I thought you took lunch, Bill?"
he snaps back,
"Go fuck yourself, Frank; you've got a job to fill."
